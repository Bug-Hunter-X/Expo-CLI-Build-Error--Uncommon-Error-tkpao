# Expo CLI Uncommon Build Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered while building an Expo project using the Expo CLI. The error message is generally unhelpful, making debugging challenging.  The issue stems from inconsistencies in project dependencies or configurations.

**Problem:**

The exact error message varies, but it's typically a cryptic failure during the build process, providing minimal information about the root cause.  This makes pinpointing the source difficult, even with detailed log analysis.

**Solution:**

The solution involves careful examination of the project's `package.json` and `app.json` files.  Mismatched dependencies or incorrect configurations within these files are the most common culprits.  Sometimes, cleaning the project's cache and reinstalling dependencies can also resolve the problem.

**Steps to Reproduce (Illustrative):**

1.  Create a new Expo project using `expo init my-app`.
2.  (Simulate the issue): Introduce a conflict in `package.json` (e.g., conflicting version ranges for a dependency).
3.  Attempt to build the app using `expo start`.
4.  Observe the vague and unhelpful error message from the Expo CLI.

**Resolution (Illustrative):**

1.  Examine the `package.json` carefully for dependency conflicts.  Ensure all dependency versions are compatible.
2.  Review the `app.json` file, verifying all configurations are correct and aligned with the used libraries.
3.  Run `expo prebuild` to ensure all required native modules are correctly installed.
4.  If problems persist, try `expo clean` and reinstall dependencies with `expo install` or `npm install`.
