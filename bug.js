This error typically occurs when you're using a library or feature in Expo that's not fully compatible with your project setup or the version of Expo CLI you're using.  It's often linked to mismatched dependencies or incorrect configurations within your `app.json` or `package.json` files. The error message itself is vague, so debugging requires examining the surrounding context and build logs more thoroughly.
