The key to resolving this type of error lies in meticulous dependency management and configuration review. There's no single 'fix' as the root cause varies. The `bug.js` file (if applicable) would contain the code that initially triggered the vague error. Here's a general approach focusing on dependency and configuration checks:

1. **Dependency Resolution:**
   - Examine your `package.json`. Look for conflicting dependency versions or unmet peer dependencies.  Use tools like `npm ls` or `yarn why` to analyze dependency trees.
   - Check for `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` to make sure your dependencies and their versions are consistent across your development team. If you're sharing the project among different developers, these lock files are a must.
   - If you have custom native modules, ensure they're properly linked and compatible with your Expo SDK version.
   - Update your packages to their latest compatible versions using `expo upgrade` or `npm update` (use with caution; check for breaking changes).

2. **Configuration Validation:**
   - Check your `app.json` for errors in configuration related to assets, plugins, or other settings.  Incorrect paths or invalid settings could trigger cryptic errors.
   - Verify that the settings in `app.json` are consistent with your project's setup and the libraries used.
   - Ensure that your device settings and project are compatible for example emulator selection.

3. **Cleaning and Reinstalling:**
   - Try `expo clean` to clear the project's cache.
   - Then reinstall packages: `expo install` or `npm install`.
   - Restart the Expo CLI.

4. **Log Analysis:**
   - Carefully review the complete output of the Expo CLI during the build process.  Look for more informative error messages or warnings that may precede the vague error.
   - Increase logging verbosity if possible to give yourself more information. 

5. **Reproduce with a Minimal Project:**
   - If the error persists, try recreating the issue in a minimal Expo project to isolate the problem. This helps to eliminate potential conflicts from other parts of your codebase.
